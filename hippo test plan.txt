it possible to test a game i am developin gon my iphone?Identified development question and pinpointed clarifying information needed.The user is asking about testing a game they're developing on their iPhone. This is a development/mobile testing question, not infrastructure-related.
I need some clarifying information before I can give accurate guidance:

What platform/engine are they using to develop the game? (Unity, Unreal, native Swift/Objective-C, React Native, Godot, etc.)
Do they have an Apple Developer account? (Free vs paid - this affects testing options significantly)
What OS are they developing on? (Mac is typically required for iOS deployment, though there are workarounds)

Let me ask these questions concisely since they're in information-gathering mode preference.Yes, it's possible. To give you accurate options, I need a few details:

What engine/framework are you using? (Unity, Unreal, Godot, native Swift, web-based, etc.)
Are you developing on Mac or Windows?
Do you have an Apple Developer account? (Free Apple ID, or paid $99/year program?)

The answers will determine which testing method applies to your situation.RetryBcreated js with Claude code so can have it build anything.WIndowsNoEvaluated web-based testing alternatives bypassing native iOS requirements.The user is developing a JavaScript-based game, working on Windows, and has no Apple Developer account. Let me think through the options:

No Apple Developer account + Windows = No native iOS app testing via Xcode (requires Mac + developer account for sideloading)
JavaScript game = This opens up web-based options that bypass the iOS app store/sideloading requirements entirely

Options available:

Progressive Web App (PWA) - Host the game on any web server, open in Safari on iPhone, add to home screen. Works like an app, no developer account needed.
Local network testing - Run a local dev server on Windows, access from iPhone on same network via IP address in Safari.
Services like itch.io or GitHub Pages - Free hosting for web games, accessible from any browser including iPhone Safari.
Expo (if React Native) - But they said JS, not specifically React Native, so probably not relevant.

Since it's a JS game built with Claude Code, the simplest path is web-based testing - no Apple account needed, no Mac needed.
I should ask what type of JS game (canvas-based, DOM-based, using a framework like Phaser, Three.js, etc.) to ensure compatibility advice is accurate, and whether they want it to feel like an "app" (PWA) or just browser testing is fine.Good news — since it's a JavaScript game, you can bypass Apple's developer requirements entirely by testing it as a web app in Safari on your iPhone.
Two main approaches:

Local network testing — Run a local dev server on your Windows machine, access it from your iPhone via your PC's local IP address (both devices on same WiFi)
Host it online — Push to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or itch.io (all free), then open the URL on your iPhone

Quick questions before I give you specific steps:

Do you want it to feel like a native app (full screen, home screen icon), or is browser testing sufficient for now?
Is the game using any specific JS framework? (Phaser, Three.js, plain canvas, DOM-based, etc.)
RetryBI want it to feel native as possible. No specific framework yet. Suggestions?Weighed PWA and framework options, sought clarification on game type.The user wants their JS game to feel as native as possible on iPhone, and they're open to framework suggestions. Let me think about this:
For native-like feel on iOS via web:

Progressive Web App (PWA) is the way to go - allows adding to home screen, full screen, can work offline
Service workers for offline capability
Web App Manifest for the native-like install experience

For JS game frameworks that work well on mobile:

Phaser - very mature, excellent mobile support, good touch controls
PixiJS - 2D rendering, lighter weight than Phaser
Kaboom.js - simpler, good for beginners
Three.js - if 3D is needed
Plain Canvas - if it's simple enough

The user is using Claude Code, so they can have Claude build whatever. I should ask what type of game they're making before recommending a framework.
Key info I need:

What type of game? (2D platformer, puzzle, card game, 3D, etc.)
Performance requirements

Then I can recommend framework + PWA setup.For native-like feel, you'll want a Progressive Web App (PWA) setup. This gives you:

Full screen (no Safari UI)
Home screen icon
Launch splash screen
Offline capability
No App Store needed

For the framework, it depends on your game type. Quick options:
TypeRecommendation2D arcade/platformer/actionPhaser 3 — mature, excellent mobile touch support, huge communitySimple 2D / puzzle / cardsKaboom.js — lighter, easier to learn, good for Claude Code to generate3DThree.jsVery simple / DOM-basedPlain Canvas + vanilla JS
What kind of game are you building? (genre, rough description)
Once I know that, I can recommend the best framework and have you set up a PWA-ready project structure that Claude Code can build on.
